# Tic-tac-toe
> This is a famous tic-tac-toe game which I have implemented in java with ***GUI***(mainly java swing).

*To explore my project, I have addded a "MyGame.jar" file.*

**To start a game, just select a mode and click on start game**

### It has four different modes
#### Easy mode:
* In this mode, computer makes a random move from avalable moves.

#### Medium mode:
* Computer use a random choice for getting a move
* It takes a move from either random computer move or smart computer.

#### Captain mode:
* It is toughest mode for a player to win against it.
* It takes move from smart computer which works on minimax algorithm.

#### Multiplayer mode:
* Here two player can play with each other.
* All moves will be made by both players.
